1. The algorithm relies on the assumption that while there is no synchronized clock across the processes, still the local time in every process flows approximately at the same rate, with an error which is small compared to the auto-release time of the lock. 

> 该算法依赖于这样一个假设:虽然各个进程之间没有同步时钟，但每个进程中的本地时间仍然以大约相同的速率流动，与锁的自动释放时间相比，这个错误很小。

2. At this point we need to better specify our mutual exclusion rule: it is guaranteed only as long as the client holding the lock will terminate its work within the lock validity time (as obtained in step 3), minus some time (just a few milliseconds in order to compensate for clock drift between processes).
