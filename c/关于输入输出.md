#### 奇怪的示例

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    scanf("a=%d", &a);
    scanf("b=%d", &b);
    printf("a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);
    return 0;
}
```

输入`a=99`，按下回车键，程序竟然运行结束了，只有第一个 scanf() 成功读取了数据，第二个 scanf() 仿佛没有执行一样，根本没有给用户任何机会去输入数据。

**尝试根据缓冲区去解释**。

#### 关于缓冲区

根据数据刷新（也可以称为清空缓冲区，就是将缓冲区中的数据“倒出”）的时机，可以分为全缓冲、行缓冲、不带缓冲。

#### 概念

##### EOF

It is used as the value returned by several functions in header [<cstdio>](http://www.cplusplus.com/cstdio) to **indicate that the End-of-File has been reached** or to signal some other failure conditions.

It is also used as the value to **represent an invalid character**.

#### 输入输出函数

##### scanf

`int scanf ( const char * format, ... )`

format

C string that contains a sequence of characters that control how characters extracted from the stream are treated:

- **Whitespace character:** the function will **read** and **ignore** any whitespace characters encountered before the next non-whitespace character (whitespace characters include spaces, newline and tab characters -- see [isspace](http://www.cplusplus.com/isspace)). A single whitespace in the *format* string validates any quantity of whitespace characters extracted from the *stream* (including none).
- **Non-whitespace character, except format specifier (%):** Any character that is not either a whitespace character (blank, newline or tab) or part of a *format specifier* (which begin with a `%` character) causes the function to read the next character from the stream, compare it to this non-whitespace character and if it matches, it is discarded and the function continues with the next character of *format*. **If the character does not match, the function fails, returning and leaving subsequent characters of the stream unread**.
- **Format specifiers:** A sequence formed by an initial percentage sign (`%`) indicates a format specifier, which is used to specify the type and format of the data to be retrieved from the *stream* and stored into the locations pointed by the additional arguments.

**注意**：当控制字符串以格式控制符开头时，会忽略缓冲区中的空白符（spaces, newline and tab characters）。

##### gets

`char * gets ( char * str )`

Reads characters from the *standard input* ([stdin](http://www.cplusplus.com/stdin)) and stores them as a C string into *str* until a newline character or the *end-of-file* is reached.

The newline character, if found, is not copied into *str*.

A terminating null character is automatically appended after the characters copied to *str*.

Notice that `gets` is quite different from [fgets](http://www.cplusplus.com/fgets): not only `gets` uses [stdin](http://www.cplusplus.com/stdin) as source, but it does not include the ending newline character in the resulting string and does not allow to specify a maximum size for *str* (which can lead to buffer overflows).

##### fflush

`int fflush ( FILE * stream )`

If the given *stream* was open for writing (or if it was open for updating and the last i/o operation was an output operation) any unwritten data in its output buffer is written to the file.

If *stream* is a null pointer, all such streams are flushed.

In all other cases, the behavior depends on the specific library implementation. In some implementations, flushing a stream open for reading causes its input buffer to be cleared (but this is not portable expected behavior).

The stream remains open after this call.

When a file is closed, either because of a call to [fclose](http://www.cplusplus.com/fclose) or because the program terminates, all the buffers associated with it are automatically flushed.

##### feof

`int feof ( FILE * stream )`

Checks whether the *end-of-File indicator* associated with *stream* is set, returning a value different from zero if it is.

This indicator is generally set by a previous operation on the *stream* that attempted to read at or past the end-of-file.

**Notice that *stream*'s internal position indicator may point to the *end-of-file* for the next operation, but still, the *end-of-file* indicator may not be set until an operation attempts to read at that point.**

这句话的意思是：文件位置指针不会指向 end-of-file，除非读取到文件最后一个字符后再向后读取一次。

This indicator is cleared by a call to [clearerr](http://www.cplusplus.com/clearerr), [rewind](http://www.cplusplus.com/rewind), [fseek](http://www.cplusplus.com/fseek), [fsetpos](http://www.cplusplus.com/fsetpos) or [freopen](http://www.cplusplus.com/freopen). Although if the *position indicator* is not repositioned by such a call, the next i/o operation is likely to set the indicator again.
